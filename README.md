Week 2 update- 15-01-24 Found research papers as per sir's advice. One contains detection of indian food specifically(cornell) and the other one use deep learning to detect food. These are helpful and now we will try to extract data/code from these papers. Found a code of visual food recognition with paper, need to do research which one to use.
